# Cpp-BST-and-brick-sorter
This is the code for the tasks in my C++ coursework in my third year of university. 
The coursework had 5 tasks, 4 of which required written parts in the report file:

~Task 1: Create a binary search tree data structure and its methods. In the report file, list the methods of the data structure and list their best-case, worst-case, and average-case time complexity.

~Task 2: Write an algorithm to sort a list of bricks, contained in the "Great_Wall_Problem-test_data" folder. Each brick has 2 different keys and the algroithm must sort the keys by placing the bricks end-to-end where the back-end of the first brick has the same key as the front-end of the second brick. The code given takes an argv input, which should be the location of the brick list file.

~Task 3: Talk about the standard library data structures that you have used in the code for task 2 and why you chose them for the task.

~Task 4: Talk in more detail about how the data structures you used in task 2 work under the hood.

~Task 5: Write a testing file for the task 2 code that uses it to sort against every single brick list in the folder and measure how long it takes to do it. Then analyse the time and explain the findings.
